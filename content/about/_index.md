Hi, I'm ****Zakariya Oulhadj**** 👋🏼

An aspiring software engineer passionate about low-level programming and
high-performance design. I specialise in **C** and **C++** with experience in Python as
well. My main interests include **computer graphics, rendering engine
architecture, and systems programming**, where I focus on building efficient
software from first principles.

Recently graduated with a distinction in **High-Performance Computing (M.Sc.)** from
the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) and currently based in London, UK. For further
details you can view my [CV](/Zakariya_Oulhadj_CV.pdf).

Full time Linux user running Debian 13 (Trixie) with my main editor of choice
for programming being [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). My dotfiles are available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ZOulhadj/dotfiles).

I am currently developing my own real-time cross-platform rendering engine in C
aiming to support multiple rendering APIs through a custom render command
system.
