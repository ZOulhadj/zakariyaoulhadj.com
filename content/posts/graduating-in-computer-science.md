I am very happy to announce that Iâ€™ve graduated with First Class Honours in
Computer Science from The University of Roehampton ðŸŽ‰. It has been a long but
fulfilling experience with many ups and downs along the way and Iâ€™d like to
thank my family, friends and professors who have supported me. This is a big
milestone for me and one which can hopefully open the door for many
opportunities going forward.
