I have known about Linux for several years and have attempted multiple times to
fully transition over from Windows/macOS. So far, these attempts have been
unsuccessful for numerous reasons. For example, software not being supported on
Linux, lack of features or issues such as failing to wake from sleep, freezing
and applications crashing caused by driver bugs.

As an aspiring programmer, I know how beneficial Linux is and how much easier
software development becomes. This is why, I have made it one of my goals to
fully transition over to Linux. Throughout 2024, I would like to better
understand the underlying operating system, create my own dotfiles and use Linux
on a daily basis.

At the moment, I am using Ubuntu with i3 as my window manager. Over time, once
my dotfiles are more or less complete then I would like to move over to Arch due
to its simplicity, AUR and its rolling-release architecture.

If all goes well, I will be making a follow up post in six months time to
showcase my progress including the things I have learnt at the half way mark.
