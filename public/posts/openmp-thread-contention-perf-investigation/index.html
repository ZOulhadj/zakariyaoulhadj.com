    <p>As part of the Threaded Programming (<a class="link" href="http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/25-26/dpt/cxepcc11003.htm"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >EPCC11003</a>) course, I investigated the
performance of three solver implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solver 1 (Recursive Tasks)</li>
<li>Solver 2 (Shared Queue)</li>
<li>Solver 2 (Separate Queues)</li>
</ul>
<p>The original serial implementation provided uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm
for an adaptive quadrature method that computes the integral of a function on a
closed interval. The algorithm starts by applying two quadrature rules (3-point
and 5-point Simpsonâ€™s rules) to the whole interval. If the difference between
the integral estimates from the two rules is small enough (or the interval is
too short), the result in added to the total integral estimate. If it is not
small enough, the interval is split into two equal halves, and the method is
applied recursively to each halves, and the method is applied recursively to
each half. The evaluating the function requires the solution of an ODE (ordinary
differential equation) which is relatively expensive in time.</p>
<h2 id="solver-1--recursive-tasks"><a href="#solver-1--recursive-tasks" class="header-anchor"></a>Solver 1 (Recursive Tasks)
</h2><p>The first program, Solver 1, implements the divide-and-conquer algorithm
recursively using OpenMP tasks. A parallel region is created at the root simpson
function call, executed by a single thread. During the recursive process, when
an interval is divided into two, a new task is created for each half. Before
returning from a recursive call, a taskwait directive is used to ensure that
both subtasks have finished execution.</p>
<p>The execution times indicate two varying performance characteristics between ICC
v20.4 (Intel C/C++ Compiler) and GCC v10.2.0 (GNU Compiler Collections). The
Intel compiler consistently outperforms GCC on all thread counts, showing strong
scalability. This can be attributed to compiler optimisations which produce more
efficient assembly instructions for the Intel Xeon E5- 2695 processor used on
the Cirrus compute node. Beyond 16 threads, GCC performance deteriorates
significantly, with a sharp increase in execution time and therefore, decline in
scalability. The runtime disparity between the compilers reaches 11.776 seconds
on 32 threads. Inefficiencies in the compiler and increased overhead associated
with task creation may be the contributing factors. Further analysis was carried
out to determine whether these results were specifically isolated to GCC version
10.2.0. Versions 8.2.0 and 12.3.0 exhibited similar behaviour, suggesting that
the issue may stem from a long- standing bug or inefficiency in the compilerâ€™s
code generation. The results are also shown in terms of speed up indicating that
ICC was able to achieve the highest speed-up of 20.995x compared to GCC 2.143x
on 32 threads.</p>

<h2 id="solver-2--shared-queue"><a href="#solver-2--shared-queue" class="header-anchor"></a>Solver 2 (Shared Queue)
</h2><p>Solver 2 implements the same algorithm but utilises a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
queue for managing intervals. OpenMP locks were introduced to ensure thread-safe
enqueuing and dequeuing operations on the shared queue. The termination criteria
was revised to account for scenarios where the queue might be empty while
intervals are still being processed. As a result, the computation only completes
when the queue is empty and no threads remain active.</p>
<p>The execution times for both the ICC and GCC compilers are similar, with
standard deviations of 8.084 and 7.719 seconds, respectively. Execution times
generally decrease as the number of threads increases. However, beyond 16
threads, both compilers exhibit an increase in execution time of approximately
3.567 seconds, with performance becoming more irregular. This is attributed to
the synchronisation overhead introduced by frequent locking and unlocking of the
shared queue as threads compete for access. Consequently, the performance gains
achievable with this implementation are inherently limited by this bottleneck,
highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Another factor affecting
performance is the lack of load balancing, which results in certain threads
having more work whilst others are idle.</p>

<h2 id="solver-2--separate-queues"><a href="#solver-2--separate-queues" class="header-anchor"></a>Solver 2 (Separate Queues)
</h2><p>To address the performance limitations of using a shared queue, a second
implementation of Solver 2 was developed in which each thread maintains its own
separate queue. If the current threads queue is not empty, then an interval is
dequeued. However, if it is empty, then the thread attempts to &ldquo;steal work&rdquo; from
another thread for processing. Work is distributed in a round-robin fashion to
ensure load balancing, keeping the number of tasks in each threadâ€™s queue
roughly equal. Each queue access is again synchronised using OpenMP locks.</p>
<p>Performance results, demonstrate a significant improvement compared to the first
Solver 2 using a single queue. The program reduces contention for queue access,
as each thread operates on its queue, leading to better scalability with larger
thread counts, aligning with Amdahl&rsquo;s Law. The execution time is comparable to
that of Solver 1 using the ICC compiler. The speed up increasing sub-linearly
for both compilers, reaching a maximum of 20.174x and 21.523x for ICC and GCC
respectively on 32 threads.</p>

></p>
<p>Further investigation into queue contention measured average accesses per second
comparing Solver 2 with a single shared queue versus Solver 2 using separate
queues. The access difference between the two implementations. It verifies that
using a single queue causes contention between threads whereas using separate
queues can achieve greater accesses per second.</p>

<p>The downside to this approach, however, is that total memory utilisation
increases to 34.56 MB com- pared to 0.48 MB for a single queue. This balance
between performance and memory usage is a common factor that needs to be
considered when implementing high performance software. Overall, the findings of
this report highlight the impact of resource contention on a programâ€™s
efficiency. In- creasing the number of threads alone does not guarantee
improvements. By addressing bottlenecks in queue accesses, both efficiency and
scalability are enhanced, which is essential for managing large workloads in
High-Performance Computing.</p>
