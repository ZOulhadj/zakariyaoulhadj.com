        <title>Studying High Performance Computing</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently been offered a place at University of Edinburgh to study High
Performance Computing (HPC) for my postgraduate degree. This is an amazing
opportunity and one which I am extremely grateful for. It is a big step up for
me both academically as well as for my future career aspirations and I am really
looking forward to starting in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My decision to study this course stems from my profound interest in software
development and hardware architecture with a particular focus on performance
optimisation. Understanding how these two interoperate will enable me to address
the computational challenges inherent in modern software. Being taught by
professors and experts from EPCC and the University would give me the invaluable
knowledge and skills to make an impact in my future career as a software
engineer. Specialising in performance optimisation would also prepare me to
potentially pursue further research for a PHD in HPC.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Linux in 2024 (Part 2)</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/using-linux-in-2024-part-2/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having daily driven my Linux laptop (Arch btw) for 6 months now I have quite a
few observations. The main issue Iâ€™ve had is full system reboots due to the
amdgpu GPU driver crashing. After a few months of investigation I believe that
the core of the issue is related to P-State and how the CPU manages power.
Having said this, I have not had a crash for at least a month now so heres
hoping that it has been fixed in a recent update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, everything else has been pretty enjoyable especially because of
how fast Linux is compared to Windows. Occasionally, I will use my Windows
desktop and perform simple tasks such as clicking on different web pages,
opening Visual Studio or just interacting with the file explorer which feels
sluggish. This is not the case on Linux which performs great even under heavy
workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a programmer, I have to say, working on Windows is a pain. Many tools that
are commonplace on Linux are simply not available and even if they are, I have
to deal with installation directories being totally random as well as poor
performance. For example, running git pull takes a good 2 seconds just to run
the program whereas on Linux its seemingly instant. To be fair, this could be as
a result of a another issue but I am not totally sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Iâ€™m pretty happy with how things are going and will see how things go
towards the end of the year and if I will continue using Linux full time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have known about Linux for several years and have attempted multiple times to
fully transition over from Windows/macOS. So far, these attempts have been
unsuccessful for numerous reasons. For example, software not being supported on
Linux, lack of features or issues such as failing to wake from sleep, freezing
and applications crashing caused by driver bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aspiring programmer, I know how beneficial Linux is and how much easier
software development becomes. This is why, I have made it one of my goals to
fully transition over to Linux. Throughout 2024, I would like to better
understand the underlying operating system, create my own dotfiles and use Linux
on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I am using Ubuntu with i3 as my window manager. Over time, once
my dotfiles are more or less complete then I would like to move over to Arch due
to its simplicity, AUR and its rolling-release architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, I will be making a follow up post in six months time to
showcase my progress including the things I have learnt at the half way mark.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce that Iâ€™ve graduated with First Class Honours in
Computer Science from The University of Roehampton ðŸŽ‰. It has been a long but
fulfilling experience with many ups and downs along the way and Iâ€™d like to
thank my family, friends and professors who have supported me. This is a big
milestone for me and one which can hopefully open the door for many
opportunities going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
