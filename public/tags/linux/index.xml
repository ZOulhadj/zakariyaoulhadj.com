        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having daily driven my Linux laptop (Arch btw) for 6 months now I have quite a
few observations. The main issue I’ve had is full system reboots due to the
amdgpu GPU driver crashing. After a few months of investigation I believe that
the core of the issue is related to P-State and how the CPU manages power.
Having said this, I have not had a crash for at least a month now so heres
hoping that it has been fixed in a recent update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, everything else has been pretty enjoyable especially because of
how fast Linux is compared to Windows. Occasionally, I will use my Windows
desktop and perform simple tasks such as clicking on different web pages,
opening Visual Studio or just interacting with the file explorer which feels
sluggish. This is not the case on Linux which performs great even under heavy
workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a programmer, I have to say, working on Windows is a pain. Many tools that
are commonplace on Linux are simply not available and even if they are, I have
to deal with installation directories being totally random as well as poor
performance. For example, running git pull takes a good 2 seconds just to run
the program whereas on Linux its seemingly instant. To be fair, this could be as
a result of a another issue but I am not totally sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’m pretty happy with how things are going and will see how things go
towards the end of the year and if I will continue using Linux full time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have known about Linux for several years and have attempted multiple times to
fully transition over from Windows/macOS. So far, these attempts have been
unsuccessful for numerous reasons. For example, software not being supported on
Linux, lack of features or issues such as failing to wake from sleep, freezing
and applications crashing caused by driver bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aspiring programmer, I know how beneficial Linux is and how much easier
software development becomes. This is why, I have made it one of my goals to
fully transition over to Linux. Throughout 2024, I would like to better
understand the underlying operating system, create my own dotfiles and use Linux
on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I am using Ubuntu with i3 as my window manager. Over time, once
my dotfiles are more or less complete then I would like to move over to Arch due
to its simplicity, AUR and its rolling-release architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, I will be making a follow up post in six months time to
showcase my progress including the things I have learnt at the half way mark.&lt;/p&gt;
