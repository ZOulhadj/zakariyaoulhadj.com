        <title>Studying High Performance Computing</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently been offered a place at University of Edinburgh to study High
Performance Computing (HPC) for my postgraduate degree. This is an amazing
opportunity and one which I am extremely grateful for. It is a big step up for
me both academically as well as for my future career aspirations and I am really
looking forward to starting in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My decision to study this course stems from my profound interest in software
development and hardware architecture with a particular focus on performance
optimisation. Understanding how these two interoperate will enable me to address
the computational challenges inherent in modern software. Being taught by
professors and experts from EPCC and the University would give me the invaluable
knowledge and skills to make an impact in my future career as a software
engineer. Specialising in performance optimisation would also prepare me to
potentially pursue further research for a PHD in HPC.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce that Iâ€™ve graduated with First Class Honours in
Computer Science from The University of Roehampton ðŸŽ‰. It has been a long but
fulfilling experience with many ups and downs along the way and Iâ€™d like to
thank my family, friends and professors who have supported me. This is a big
milestone for me and one which can hopefully open the door for many
opportunities going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
